## Medical Calculator

The Medical Calculator is a Python-based tool that helps calculate the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score based on input parameters such as temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, white blood cell count, and red blood cell count. The SIRS score is commonly used in clinical settings to assess the severity of systemic inflammation.

This command-line application prompts the user to enter the required medical parameters and calculates the SIRS score accordingly. It provides real-time feedback on the abnormality of each parameter and generates a final assessment of whether the patient meets the SIRS criteria or not.

## Features

- User-friendly command-line interface for easy parameter input
- Real-time feedback on abnormal parameter values
- Calculation of the SIRS score based on input parameters
- Final assessment of SIRS criteria met or not met
